# IoT-Final-Project-Smart-Lock-System

## NET3054 Networking and Security Final Project (*September 2025*)

## Project Abstract:
This project aimed to develop a Multi-Option IoT Smart Lock System that overcomes the limitations of conventional mechanical locks and single-factor digital authentication systems, such as key duplication risks, limited flexibility, and the absence of access monitoring capabilities. The proposed system is a functional prototype that supports multiple authentication options, including RFID tag verification, keypad-based PIN entry, and mobile phone based remote unlocking. The system is designed using a four-layer IoT architecture, where an ESP32 operates at the perception layer for sensing and actuation, while a Raspberry Pi functions as the local server and IoT gateway. At the application layer, Node-RED is employed for flow-based data processing and control logic, while InfluxDB is used for structured storage of access events and lock status data. Real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities are enabled through the integrated dashboard. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reliable data transmission between the ESP32 and the gateway, consistent multi-option authentication performance, and timely access notifications, thereby improving both system security and user convenience.
